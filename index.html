                <h2>A website about my knowledge of the Medicine Wheel and it's teachings</h2>
                <p>The medicine wheel holds teachings all the way across the Americas.The medicine wheel reminds us that everything 
                    comes in fours. The four seasons, the four stages of life, the four races of humanity, four cardinal directions, 
                    etc. I, however will be talking about a teaching about the wheel that was given to me by a Sundance chief while I 
                    helped with his ceremony.</p>

                <h2>The Four Directions of the Human Body</h2>
                <p>The Medicine Wheel can be interpreted in many different ways and one of these ways is to imagine it like the 
                    human body and it's health. Each side represents one of the following: <strong>Mental health, Physical health, 
                    Emotional health and Spiritual health </strong></p>

            <section>
                <h2>Mental Health</h2>
                <p>The Sundance Chief grabbed a stick and drew a circle in the dirt and put a cross through it. 
                    He pointed to the top of the wheel and then to his own head. Then explained the importance of keeping a sharp, open mind. 
                    To exercise your brain is just as important as any other muscle in the body. If you can keep your head on straight 
                    there will be a lot less worry in the world and you will be happier as a result. </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Physical Health</h2>
                <p>He then pointed to the right side of the wheel, held out his right arm and flexed while explaining how important 
                    it is to keep a strong, healthy body. To work out your body is essential to living a long and happy life and allows 
                    you to be there for your loved ones and family for as long as possible. He told me to do something once a day that tires 
                    me out be it going for a run or chopping wood. </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Emotional Health</h2>
                <p>The man once again pointed with his stick, this time to the bottom side of the wheel which is the side of the medicine wheel 
                    that represents ones emotional health. To stay emotionally happy and strong keeps you about your wits and able to help those 
                    around you. To better yourself emotionally could be accomplished any number of ways and for some can be no short journey. 
                    For me it was through powwow and connecting to my own culture.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Spiritual Health</h2>
                <p>Lastly he pointed towards the left side of the wheel saying this direction has to do with our spiritual health as in our 
                    culture we use our left side closest to our hearts to use medicine and put down our offerings. To keep your spirit strong 
                    allows for clarity and a strong well being, both of which allow us to help others around us effectively. To keep all four 
                    directions of your medicine wheel strong is to be invincible, nothing can hurt you. </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Invincibility</h2>
                <p>He then handed the stick over to me and said to be very honest with myself and make each line thicker or thinner depending on 
                    how I am doing mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. I did so and one of the lines was thinner than the rest and 
                    he said now you know what you must work on to be healthy. Ever since I've recieved this teaching I have periodically created a wheel in the 
                    dirt or on paper to self reflect and track my healing journey. This has proved very helpful in keeping myself strong on this 
                    journey through life. There are a thousand different ways to interpret the teachings of a medicine wheel and this is one that has helped me heal.</p>
